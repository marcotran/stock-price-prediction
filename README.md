# Overview

This is a comparative analysis of various regression algorithms that can be used to predict stock prices.

Trying to predict the stock market is an enticing prospect to data scientists motivated not so much as a desire for material gain, but for the challenge. We see the daily up and downs of the market and imagine there must be patterns we, or our models, can learn in order to beat all those day traders with business degrees.

Pandas and Scikit Learn was used to develop a linear regression model to predict stock price. amCharts and Angular were used to plot the data and update the stock price charts. Optimized for desktop and mobile.

## Getting Started

In order to run a dev server on your local host, you will need to install the required python packages:

`cd ..`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can open up a terminal and start up a server for the backend on port 5000:

`set FLASK_APP=app.py`

`flask run`

Now you are all set up!
